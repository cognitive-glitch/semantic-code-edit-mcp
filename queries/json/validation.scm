;; Tree-sitter validation queries for JSON semantic editing
;; Minimal working validation - focus on patterns that actually exist in JSON grammar

;; Most JSON validation is handled by the parser itself
;; This file exists to demonstrate validation query loading
;; and can be expanded as needed for specific JSON patterns

;; For now, we keep this minimal to avoid tree-sitter grammar conflicts
